# Basic Rules

- Always use functional code
- Always prefer simple, easy-to-understand code
- Always create a .gitignore file with the build directory in it.
- Always code what the user specifies and that of which it is obvious that its within the user's specifications
- If not sure about something, ask the user
- Keep .gitignore up to date
- Comment code well
- NEVER EVER EDIT .env files
- Don't change config files unless needed
- If function line count is above 250, split into multiple smaller functions or refactor
- If file line count above 400 split into more files or refactor
